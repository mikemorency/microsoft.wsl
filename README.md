# Ansible Collection: microsoft.wsl

This repo hosts the `microsoft.wsl` Ansible Collection.

The **microsoft.wsl** collection enables the management of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) using Ansible. This collection brings forward the possibility to manage WSL distributions and automate operator tasks on Windows systems.

System programmers can enable pipelines to setup, configure and manage WSL distributions while system administrators can automate time consuming repetitive tasks inevitably freeing up their time. New WSL users can find comfort in Ansible's familiarity and expedite their proficiency in record time.


## Requirements

The content in this collection is mainly designed to run on a Windows target. The target must have Powershell installed.

There are no special requirements for the Ansible controller to run this content.

### Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.16.0**.


## Installation

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install microsoft.wsl
```

You can also include it in a requirements.yml file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```sh
collections:
  - name: microsoft.wsl
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package.
To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install microsoft.wsl --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to install a different version. Use the following syntax to install version 1.0.0:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install microsoft.wsl:1.0.0
```

## Release Notes and Roadmap

A list of available releases can be found on the github [release page](https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.wsl/releases).
A changelog may be found attached to the release, or in the [CHANGELOG.rst](https://github.com/ansible-collections/microsoft.wsl/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst)

Note, some collections release before an ansible-core version reaches End of Life (EOL), thus the version of ansible-core that is supported must be a version that is currently supported.
For AAP users, to see the supported ansible-core versions, review the [AAP Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ansible-automation-platform).
For Galaxy and GitHub users, to see the supported ansible-core versions, review the [ansible-core support matrix](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#ansible-core-support-matrix).
